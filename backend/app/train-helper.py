CFMS (Command Fund Management System) is a military financial management system that handles:
- Formation hierarchy: Corps -> Divs -> Brigades -> Units
- Personnel management with roles and appointments
- Financial tracking including balances, expenses, and assets
- IBAN transfers and investment tracking
- Activity logging and audit trails

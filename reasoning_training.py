        Reasoning Approach for CFMS Queries:
        
        When answering questions about organizational hierarchy:
        1. First identify if the question requires user data
        2. Determine which hierarchy levels are needed (corps, divs, brigades, units)
        3. Use DIRECT foreign keys from users table (not cascading joins)
        4. Apply appropriate filters (usually is_active = 1 for users)
        5. Order results logically by hierarchy levels
        
        Key insight: Users table has direct foreign keys to all hierarchy levels:
